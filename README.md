# the complete js course 5th project
This project is a simple workout tracking application that leverages geolocation, the Leaflet library for maps, and local storage for persisting data. Users can track their running and cycling workouts, view their location on a map, and see details like distance, duration, pace, or speed. Below is an overview of how the app functions and what each feature does
## Features
### Workout Tracking:
Users can input workout details (running or cycling), including duration, distance, cadence (for running), and elevation gain (for cycling).
### Map Integration:
The app uses the Leaflet library to display a map centered on the user's current geolocation.
Users can add workout markers by clicking on the map.
### Local Storage:
Workouts are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist across sessions.
### Workout Details:
For each workout, the user can view details such as distance, duration, pace (for running), speed (for cycling), and elevation gain.
### User Interaction:
The app includes a form to add workout details, which appears when clicking on the map.
Users can navigate to workout locations by clicking on the corresponding workout list item.
### Animation:
Smooth scrolling between sections, as well as animations for toggling between running and cycling workout forms.
